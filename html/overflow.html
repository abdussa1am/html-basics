    <div>A paragraph is a series of related sentences developing a central idea, called the topic.
         Try to think about paragraphs in terms of thematic unity: a paragraph is a sentence or a 
         group of sentences that supports one central, unified idea. Paragraphs add one idea at a
          time to your broader argument.</div>
